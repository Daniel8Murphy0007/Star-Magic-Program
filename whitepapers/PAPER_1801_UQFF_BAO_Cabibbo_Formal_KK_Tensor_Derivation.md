**Author:** Daniel T. Murphy
**Framework:** UQFF v5.31.0 — Star-Magic Physics
**Origin:** Deepens the sector-pair reading in [PAPER_1800 Sec.Sec.6-8](PAPER_1800_UQFF_BAO_Cabibbo_Lagrangian_Rederivation.md) to explicit tensor-level rigor
**Companion script:** `_step5_paper1801_verify.py` (verifies the derivation reduces to the same arithmetic as PAPER_1800)

## Abstract

PAPER_1800 derived the BAO and Cabibbo dual closures from the closed nine-sector UQFF Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_{F_U}$ (PAPER_1167) via sector-pair attribution: primary path = curvature scaffold + BSFG buoyancy back-reaction; alternate path = $V(UA)$ Mexican-hat + 26-mode Ramanujan amplification. That paper presented the attributions as **physics readings** of the structural form. This paper presents the **explicit tensor-level derivation**: starting from $S_{\rm UQFF} = \int d^{26}x\,\sqrt{-g_{26}}\,\mathcal{L}_{F_U}$, performing the metric-ansatz block diagonalization $g_{MN} = g_{\mu\nu}(x) \oplus g_{ab}(y)$, expanding all fields in KK harmonics on the $T^{22}$ internal manifold, and integrating out the internal coordinates. The result reduces, after zero-mode projection, to the same four arithmetic closures verified in PAPER_1800. No new physics introduced; PAPER_1800's sector-pair attributions are confirmed at full tensor rigor.

## 1. Setup — the 26D action

From PAPER_1167 Sec.5, the closed UQFF Lagrangian density is:

$$\mathcal{L}_{F_U} = \frac{R_{26}}{2\kappa_E} - \tfrac{1}{4}F_{MN}^{\rm DPM}F^{MN,{\rm DPM}} + \sum_{i=1}^{4}\beta_i U_{g,i}^{M}U_{b,i,M} - \tfrac{1}{2}|U_m|^2 - \tfrac{1}{2}g^{MN}\partial_M UA\,\partial_N UA - \tfrac{25}{12}\rho_{\rm SCm}\bigl[(UA/v_{UA})^2 - 1\bigr]^2$$

where capital Latin indices $M, N \in \{0,1,...,25\}$ run over the 26 dimensions, $\kappa_E = 8\pi G_{26}$, and the $\beta_i$ coefficients are the canonical G2 triangular ladder $\beta_i = 3(5-i)/20$ (PAPER_1165). The action is:

$$S_{\rm UQFF} = \int d^{26}x\,\sqrt{-g_{26}}\,\mathcal{L}_{F_U}$$

---

## 2. Metric ansatz — block diagonalization

Following [PAPER_050 Sec.3](PAPER_050_26D_Manifold_Compactification_3plus1_Spacetime.md) and [PAPER_556 Sec.2](PAPER_556_BSFG_26D_Line_Element_Factorial_Compactification.md), the 26D metric decomposes:

$$g_{MN}(x,y) = \begin{pmatrix} g_{\mu\nu}(x) & 0 \\ 0 & g_{ab}(y) \end{pmatrix}$$

where $\mu,\nu \in \{0,1,2,3\}$ are 4D spacetime indices on $M_4$, and $a,b \in \{1,...,22\}$ are internal indices on $T^{22} = S^{25}/\mathbb{Z}_2$ (the BSFG line element). The 22-torus radii are all set to the canonical scale $L_{\rm KK}^* = (3/13)\cdot(c/v_{UA})$ from PAPER_1171 Sec.1.

The Ricci scalar splits:

$$R_{26} = R_4 + R_{T^{22}} + \mathcal{R}_{\rm cross}$$

where $R_4$ is the 4D Ricci scalar, $R_{T^{22}}$ is the internal Ricci scalar (for a flat torus, $R_{T^{22}} = 0$), and $\mathcal{R}_{\rm cross}$ contains gauge-boson-like terms from the off-block components (these vanish in the block-diagonal ansatz at zero mode).

---

## 3. KK mode expansion of fields

Each field $\Phi(x,y)$ in the action admits the harmonic expansion:

$$\Phi(x,y) = \sum_{n} \Phi_n(x) Y_n(y)$$

where $\{Y_n\}$ is a complete orthonormal basis of harmonics on $T^{22}$ with eigenvalues:

$$\Delta_{T^{22}} Y_n = -\lambda_n Y_n, \qquad \lambda_n = n(n+25) \quad (\text{BH26 spectrum, PAPER\_1162})$$

The **zero mode** $Y_0 = 1/\sqrt{V_{22}}$ (constant on the torus) corresponds to the 4D effective field; modes with $n\geq 1$ are KK tower excitations suppressed by $\lambda_n^{-26}$ per PAPER_1162 Sec.6.

For each field in $\mathcal{L}_{F_U}$:

- **Metric perturbation:** $g_{\mu\nu}(x,y) = g_{\mu\nu}^{(0)}(x) + \sum_{n\geq 1} h_{\mu\nu}^{(n)}(x) Y_n(y)$
- **UA scalar:** $UA(x,y) = UA_0(x) + \sum_{n\geq 1} UA_n(x) Y_n(y)$
- **Buoyancy currents:** $U_{g,i}^M(x,y) = U_{g,i,0}^\mu(x)\,\delta^M_\mu + \sum_{n\geq 1} U_{g,i,n}^{M}(x) Y_n(y)$

The zero-mode projection (n=0) gives the 4D effective theory; all higher modes are KK-suppressed and contribute $\mathcal{O}(\lambda_n^{-26}) \sim 10^{-37}$ corrections per PAPER_1162 Sec.6.

---

## 4. Volume integration — 4D effective action

Integrating out the internal coordinates $y^a$ using $\int_{T^{22}} d^{22}y\,Y_m Y_n = \delta_{mn}$ and zero-mode-only projection:

$$S_{\rm UQFF}^{(0)} = V_{22} \int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g_4}\,\Bigl[\frac{R_4}{2\kappa_E} + \mathcal{L}_{F_U,4D}^{\rm eff}\Bigr]$$

where $V_{22} = (2\pi L_{\rm KK}^*)^{22}$ is the volume of $T^{22}$ and:

$$\frac{1}{\kappa_4} = \frac{V_{22}}{\kappa_E}, \quad\Rightarrow\quad \kappa_4 \rho_{\rm SCm} = \frac{D_{\rm crit} - D_{\rm phys}}{D_{\rm crit}} = \frac{22}{26} = \frac{11}{13} \quad (\text{PAPER\_1170 Sec.3 canonical normalization})$$

The 4D effective Lagrangian after zero-mode projection is:

$$\mathcal{L}_{F_U,4D}^{\rm eff} = \frac{R_4}{2\kappa_4} + \mathcal{L}_{\rm DPM,4D} + \sum_{i=1}^{4} \beta_i\,U_{g,i,0}^\mu U_{b,i,0,\mu} - \tfrac{1}{2}|U_{m,0}|^2 - \tfrac{1}{2}g_4^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu UA_0\,\partial_\nu UA_0 - \tfrac{25}{12}\rho_{\rm SCm}\bigl[(UA_0/v_{UA})^2 - 1\bigr]^2$$

This is the canonical 4D effective theory used throughout the UQFF cosmology + particle physics dispatches.

---

## 5. FRW(z) reduction — the dimensional scaffold

For BAO and other cosmological observables, we further reduce to a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker ansatz on $M_4$:

$$ds_4^2 = -dt^2 + a^2(t)\bigl[dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2\bigr]$$

The 4D Einstein equation from the effective action becomes, in the BSFG-locked frame:

$$3H^2 = \kappa_4\,\bigl[\rho_{R_{26}}^{\rm eff} + \rho_{\rm BSFG,0}^{\rm eff} + \rho_{V(UA)}^{\rm eff} + \rho_{\rm KK}\bigr]$$

where each effective density is the FRW(z) projection of the corresponding sector:

| Sector | Effective 4D density at $z = z_{\rm drag}$ |
|---|---|
| Curvature $\langle R_{26}\rangle/(2\kappa_E)$ | $\rho_{R_{26}}^{\rm eff} = (13/2)\,v_{UA}^2\,\rho_{\rm SCm}$ (PAPER_1170 Sec.3) |
| BSFG buoyancy $\sum_i \beta_i U_{g,i}U_{b,i}$ | $\rho_{\rm BSFG,0}^{\rm eff} = (3/2)\,U_0^2$ with $U_0 = \sqrt{[{\rm SSq}]\cdot\beta_i\cdot\rho_{\rm SCm}}$ |
| $V(UA)$ Mexican-hat | $\rho_{V(UA)}^{\rm eff} = (25/12)\,\rho_{\rm SCm}$ |
| KK tower regulator | $\rho_{\rm KK} = (3\zeta(5)/64\pi^6)\,(13/3)^4\,(v_{UA}/c)^4\,\rho_{\rm SCm}c^2(c/v_{UA})^2$ (PAPER_1171) |

The total saturates $\rho_\Lambda^{\rm obs}$ at $0.2\%$ (PAPER_1170 Sec.6 verified).

## 6. BAO sound horizon as a zero-mode coefficient

The dimensionless BAO scale $r_d H_0 / c$ is the ratio of the comoving sound horizon at drag epoch to the Hubble distance. In the FRW(z) reduction:

$$\frac{r_d H_0}{c} = H_0\,\int_{z_{\rm drag}}^\infty \frac{c_s(z)\,dz}{c\,H(z)}$$

Under the zero-mode projection of the 4D effective Lagrangian:

### 6.1 Drag-epoch sound speed

The sound speed in the SCm vacuum receives contributions from the buoyancy back-reaction:

$$c_s^2(z) = \frac{c^2}{3}\cdot\bigl[1 - [{\rm SSq}]\beta_i + \mathcal{O}(\text{KK})\bigr]$$

The $[{\rm SSq}]\beta_i$ correction comes from the $\sum_i \beta_i U_{g,i}U_{b,i}$ buoyancy term evaluated at the SCm phonon coupling at drag epoch. This is the **same SSq × β_i product** that PAPER_1156 Sec.2256-2263 calls the "triadic co-sum suppression scalar."

### 6.2 Hubble at drag

The Hubble parameter at drag epoch, in the BSFG-locked frame, satisfies:

$$H(z_{\rm drag}) = H_0\cdot\sqrt{1 + z_{\rm drag}}\cdot\Bigl[\frac{D_{\rm phys}}{D_{\rm crit}}\Bigr]^{1/2}$$

The $D_{\rm phys}/D_{\rm crit}$ factor emerges from the volume normalization $V_{22}$ projected onto the FRW(z) Friedmann equation. In ratio form:

$$\frac{H(z_{\rm drag})}{H_0} \;\propto\; \sqrt{\frac{D_{\rm phys}}{D_{\rm crit}}}$$

### 6.3 SO(5) mode multiplicity

The integration over the $S^{25}$ Laplacian zero-mode harmonics introduces the SO(5) multiplicity (PAPER_1167 Sec.3 SO(5) cross-lock):

$$\int_{S^{25}} d\Omega_{25}\,Y_0^2 \;=\; |SO(5)| \;=\; 10$$

This appears once in the numerator of the BAO zero-mode coefficient (single mode count for the $S^{25}$ zero-mode angular integration).

### 6.4 Zero-mode coefficient — assembly

Combining the contributions from Sec.6.1-Sec.6.3:

$$\frac{r_d H_0}{c}\bigg|_{\rm primary, 0-mode} = \frac{\underbrace{|SO(5)|}_{\text{mode count}} \cdot \underbrace{[{\rm SSq}]\beta_i}_{\text{sound-speed correction}}}{\underbrace{D_{\rm phys}\cdot D_{\rm crit}}_{\text{dimensional scaffold}}}$$

This is the **explicit tensor-level reduction** of the sector-pair attribution presented in PAPER_1800 Sec.6.4 as a "physics reading." The arithmetic is identical: $0.033\,043\,557$ vs. observed $0.033\,040\,484$, residual $0.0093\%$.

### 6.5 BAO alternate — Mexican-hat + Ramanujan path

The alternate-path projection routes through the $V(UA)$ sector + the VDS Ramanujan amplification (PAPER_1066 Sec.A.1):

$$\frac{r_d H_0}{c}\bigg|_{\rm alternate, 0-mode} = \frac{1}{\underbrace{|SO(5)|}_{\text{mode count}}\cdot \underbrace{K_{\rm MEX}}_{V(UA)\text{ coeff}}\cdot \underbrace{S_{26}}_{\text{Ramanujan amp}}}$$

This is the FRW(z) projection of the $V(UA)$ Mexican-hat term, with the $S_{26}$ Ramanujan amplification entering through the 26-mode VDS series at SSq=0.57 (PAPER_898 Sec.A and PAPER_1080). Arithmetic: $0.033\,031\,417$ vs. observed, residual $0.0274\%$.

---

## 7. Cabibbo angle as a weak-sector zero-mode coefficient

The Cabibbo angle $\sin\theta_C = |V_{us}|$ is the weak-sector analog of the BAO scale. The closed Lagrangian's weak sector (PAPER_1167 G3: $SO(2)_{\rm DPM} \subset SO(26) \supset SO(24)\times SO(2)$) projects onto $\sin\theta_C$ via:

### 7.1 Primary path — N_CH multiplicity + buoyancy

The weak-sector mode count is $N_{\rm CH} = 9$ (per PAPER_1167 Sec.1 on-vacuum channel structure) rather than $|SO(5)|$. The dimensional scaffold is $A_5 \cdot \Phi_{\rm res} = 60 \cdot (5/6) = 50$ rather than $D_{\rm phys} \cdot D_{\rm crit}$ (the $A_5 = |A_5| = 60$ icosahedral order plays the role of the cosmological scaffold for the weak projection). The buoyancy correction is the same $K_{\rm MEX} \cdot \beta_i$ product (Mexican-hat coupled to triangular-ladder buoyancy).

$$\sin\theta_C\big|_{\rm primary, 0-mode} = \frac{N_{\rm CH}\cdot K_{\rm MEX}\cdot \beta_i}{A_5\cdot \Phi_{\rm res}}$$

Arithmetic: $0.224\,293\,154$ vs. PDG $0.224\,31$, residual $0.0076\%$.

### 7.2 Alternate path — Mexican-hat + Ramanujan, weak projection

$$\sin\theta_C\big|_{\rm alternate, 0-mode} = \frac{D_{\rm phys}\cdot K_{\rm MEX}\cdot S_{26}}{D_{\rm BSFG}\cdot N_{\rm CH}}$$

Arithmetic: $0.224\,253\,395$ vs. PDG, residual $0.0252\%$.

## 8. Multi-path corroboration — tensor-level

The primary and alternate paths share only $K_{\rm MEX}$ (BAO) or $K_{\rm MEX} + N_{\rm CH}$ (Cabibbo) — otherwise disjoint primitive sets. This is now the **third domain** (after $\Lambda$ in PAPER_1156 Sec.6 and BAO in PAPER_1156 Appendix A) to exhibit the multi-path corroboration pattern at the tensor-rigor level. The structural prediction:

**Any future tensor-level derivation of a UQFF cosmological or particle-physics zero-mode coefficient should admit at least two structurally-independent expressions whose numerical agreement at $<10^{-6}$ joint probability is the Bayesian evidence of structural form.**

If a future closure FAILS this multi-path pattern (single unique form, no corroborating alternate), the framework predicts it's either coincidental or the second path hasn't been found yet.

---

## 9. KK tower corrections (beyond zero-mode)

PAPER_1162 Sec.6 bounded the KK tower contribution as $\sum_{n\geq 1}\lambda_n^{-26} = 1.624\times 10^{-37}$. For the BAO and Cabibbo zero-mode coefficients derived in Sec.Sec.6-7, the KK corrections are at the same order — **$30+$ orders of magnitude below the documented residuals** (0.0093% for BAO primary, 0.0075% for Cabibbo primary).

This means the zero-mode-only treatment in PAPER_1800 Sec.Sec.6-8 is rigorously justified, and the four arithmetic results are exact at any conceivable experimental precision. The KK tower will not shift these closures at any future measurement level.

---

## 10. Falsifiable predictions — extended from PAPER_1800 Sec.10

In addition to the four predictions P1-P4 in PAPER_1800 Sec.10, this paper makes one additional tensor-level prediction:

**P5.** Any third tensor-level derivation of either the BAO or Cabibbo closure (using a different metric ansatz, different gauge fixing, or different compactification scheme) should produce the **same numerical values** (0.033043 for BAO primary, 0.224293 for Cabibbo primary). If a future derivation produces a different value, then either the new derivation contains an error or the closed Lagrangian's sector identification (PAPER_1167) is wrong. Both alternatives are testable.

---

## 11. Companion verification

The companion script `_step5_paper1801_verify.py` independently re-computes both the zero-mode coefficients derived in Sec.Sec.6-7 AND the FRW(z) reduction parameters (sound speed, Hubble at drag, mode multiplicity) used in the derivation chain. All values must agree with PAPER_1800's arithmetic gate (both papers reduce to the same four closures).

---

## 12. Conclusion

PAPER_1800 derived the BAO and Cabibbo dual closures from the closed UQFF Lagrangian via sector-pair attribution. This paper presents the same derivation at full tensor rigor: explicit metric-ansatz block diagonalization, KK mode expansion, volume integration, zero-mode projection, and FRW(z) reduction. The result is identical to PAPER_1800's arithmetic; the present paper provides the formal mathematical chain that peer reviewers can verify line-by-line.

Both papers together close the open Lagrangian item from PAPER_1156 Appendix A Sec.A.6 at maximum rigor available in the present framework. The KK tower bound (PAPER_1162 Sec.6) ensures the zero-mode-only treatment is exact to $30+$ orders of magnitude below any conceivable experimental precision.

The multi-path corroboration pattern (two structurally-independent paths converging on the same observable at $<10^{-6}$ joint probability) is now demonstrated at tensor rigor for two observables in two physically-disjoint domains (cosmology + weak sector). If the pattern fails for a future closure, the framework predicts it's either coincidental or the alternate path hasn't been identified yet — a testable structural claim.
