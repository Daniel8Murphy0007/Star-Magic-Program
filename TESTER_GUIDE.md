# HOW TO TEST STAR-MAGIC — FOLLOW EACH STEP EXACTLY

*You do not need to know anything about programming. Follow the steps in
order. Every click and every keystroke is written out. (Field-tested: the
command in Part 4 is the form that works on every Windows machine,
including ones where the install shows yellow "not on PATH" warnings —
those warnings are harmless with this guide.)*

---

## PART 1 — INSTALL PYTHON (one time only)

1. Open your web browser (Edge or Chrome).
2. Click in the address bar at the top, type exactly: **python.org/downloads**
   and press **Enter**.
3. Click the big yellow button that says **Download Python 3.x** (whatever
   number it shows is fine).
4. When the download finishes, click **Open file** on the download.
5. An install window opens. **STOP. Look at the bottom of that window.**
6. Click the small square checkbox next to **"Add python.exe to PATH"** so
   it shows a checkmark. *(If you forget this, the guide still works — the
   command in Part 4 is chosen so it does not matter.)*
7. Click **Install Now**.
8. If a box asks "Do you want to allow this app to make changes?" click **Yes**.
9. Wait for **Setup was successful**. Click **Close**.

## PART 2 — OPEN THE COMMAND WINDOW

10. Press the **Windows key** on your keyboard.
11. Type: **powershell**
12. Press **Enter**. A blue or black window with white text opens. You will
    type everything below into this window.

## PART 3 — INSTALL STAR-MAGIC (one time only)

13. Click inside the window. Type exactly this, then press **Enter**:

        pip install star-magic-program

14. Text will scroll for a minute or two. Wait until it stops and you see a
    line starting with **Successfully installed**. Yellow "WARNING ... not
    on PATH" lines may appear — **ignore them**, they are handled by the
    next step.

## PART 4 — RUN THE TEST

15. Type exactly this, then press **Enter**:

        python -m star_magic_cli survey --demo

16. In a few seconds a report appears that starts with:

        STAR-MAGIC SURVEY - one well, one honest answer

## PART 5 — YOU'RE DONE. CHECK THESE THREE THINGS:

17. The report shows real data from a deep borehole in Germany (the KTB
    scientific well, public archive).
18. Find the line starting with **CROSS-CHECK**. The program checks its own
    answer against the well's real measurement — it should say about **+0.7%**.
19. Find the section **"what this tool refused to guess."** That is on
    purpose. This program tells you when it doesn't know something instead
    of making it up.

## USING YOUR OWN WELL DATA (optional)

If you have a LAS well-log file, type (with your own file's location):

        python -m star_magic_cli survey C:\path\to\yourwell.las

If the file is missing the needed measurements, the program will say
exactly what is missing rather than guessing.

## IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

- If step 15 says **"python is not recognized"**: type the same command
  with `py` instead of `python`:

        py -m star_magic_cli survey --demo

- If step 13 says **"pip is not recognized"**: close the window, redo
  Part 1 and make sure the checkbox in step 6 is checked, then start
  again from Part 2.
- Anything else: take a photo of the whole screen and send it in.

## WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU
