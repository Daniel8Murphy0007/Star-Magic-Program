**UQFF systematic rebuild — v0.400.0 complete-compile campaign live**

**This release (v0.400.0): THE TWENTY WELLS SHIP — THE QUANTITY LEDGER CLOSES AT TWENTY ENTRIES.** `uqff_downhole_simulator` v1.26.0–v1.30.0 grows the real-data catalogue from fifteen entries to **twenty** across **twelve regions and thirteen kinds**, closing the physical-quantity ledger the catalogue has been assembling since entry 1. **v1.26.0 — KTB Pilot Hole rock mechanics** (COMPLETE, 113 lab samples 190–3,832 m): the first LABORATORY ROCK STRENGTH data, and the geomechanics pair closes LIVE — using entry 15's measured density, **59 of 113 samples are weaker than the overburden at their own depth** (foliated gneiss ~49 MPa vs amphibolite ~137 MPa): the KTB breakout physics counted from data; cell-level refusal debuts (9 rendering-ambiguous cells → NaN + raw token, typed-column rules only — nothing guessed from geology; new `read_ktb_table`). **v1.27.0 — KTB Main Hole strength** (COMPLETE, 21 deep samples): the pair completes — HB amphibolites average 199 MPa vs the VB's 77, yet at 5.5–6.2 km even amphibolites lose to overburden (5 of 21): depth wins, counted live; KTB ends at SIX entries with both holes carrying temperature AND strength. **v1.28.0 — ODP Hole 504B borehole fluids** (PANGAEA doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.805957, COMPLETE): the deepest hole in OCEANIC crust — the ocean's KTB — joins as region TEN and the first sub-seafloor entry (seafloor −3,474 m, ambient >160 °C): 8 samples × 42 channels with the seawater→basalt mixing gradient computed live (corr(depth,Mg) −0.81, corr(depth,Ca) +0.80, ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr sliding 0.70921→0.70758); the **PANGAEA self-citing textfile route is proven** (`read_pangaea_txt` — the file carries its own citation, license, coordinates and methods) after LDEO's .dat family proved fetch-blocked (forensics in provenance). **v1.29.0 — IODP U1324 measured pore pressure** (PANGAEA doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.725472, COMPLETE; Gulf of Mexico, region ELEVEN): the catalogue's LAST missing quantity — measured downhole PRESSURE, 18 penetrometer deployments 50–608 mbsf with hydrostatic AND overburden baselines travelling in the same file — and it is THE FIND occurring in nature: **all 12 baselined stations are overpressured** (max +2.07 MPa; λ* = 0.385 at 608.2 m), the shallow overpressure that preconditions this site's submarine landslides; the T2P's tip/shaft pairs are the second real dual-sensor instrument. **v1.30.0 — the ODP 1027C CORK observatory** (PANGAEA doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.722627, COMPLETE; Juan de Fuca Ridge, region TWELVE): the twentieth entry IS the instrument class this package simulates — a sealed-borehole permanent installation carrying BOTH thermal states at the same stations (drilling-disturbed vs three-years-sealed: **+42.6 °C recovery at 586.8 m** — the disturbed-vs-equilibrium distinction the KTB entries could only disclose, measured on both sides), the ~104 °C/km sediment gradient collapsing to an isothermal hydrothermal basement (0.1 °C spread), and the observatory's own service history (data recoveries, a 1999 logger replacement) in the file's comment block. The ledger stands closed: temperature, trajectory, density, strength, rates, core, fluids, pressure — all real, all provenance-complete. Catalogue: **TWENTY entries / TWELVE regions / THIRTEEN kinds** (Norway, Australia, Nova Scotia, Texas, Kansas, Greenland, Canadian Arctic, Netherlands, Germany, Pacific oceanic crust, Gulf of Mexico, Juan de Fuca). Package v1.30.0 (catalog/ 40 files, measured). **Totals: 2,253 wired (2,308 DISPATCH keys) / gate 5,882 green / 4,180 defs. Next paper: PAPER_2258.**

## Project census (accumulative, dual-scope reporting)

Per Daniel's 2026-08-08 directive, headline numbers are reported at BOTH scopes:

**Full-project totals (measured):** **4,108 functions** across 15 Python modules
(calculator 4,098 + derived-constants 1,272 + material landmarks 193 + backbone locks 127
+ session closures 74 + variant/identity/catalog modules 51 + infrastructure 17) |
**25,126 registry-family rows** across 14 CSVs (falsifiability graph 8,611 edges +
citations 6,119 + main 5,565 + XGEO 3,229 + results 187 + audit family 1,037) |
**1,417 of 2,256 whitepapers wired** (67.2% of corpus; frontier PAPER_001-1500 complete) |
**4,717 gate
assertions, 0 failures** | corpus 598,688 whitepaper lines condensed into
~50,000 Python lines (~13:1 on the covered range).

**Single-file scope** (used for per-band deltas): calculator defs, main-registry rows,
gate assertions, dispatch count — always labeled as such in CHANGELOG/SESSION_LOG entries.

## What this is

A from-scratch, systematic rebuild of the UQFF (Unified Quantum Field Framework)
calculator. This repository exists to correct a structural failure in the
predecessor repository (`github.com/Daniel8Murphy0007/Star-Magic`), where the
calculator layer had grown to 73,629 lines with 3,352 hardcoded literals that
duplicated registry-canonical values, and 1,180 whitepapers had zero calculator
wiring.

**This repository fixes that by construction:**
- One dispatch function per whitepaper. Nothing else in the calculator.
- Zero hardcoded numeric literals. Every value flows from
  `uqff_registry_primitives.py`.
- Fidelity gate (`uqff_fidelity_tests.py`) locks every primitive-composed
  identity to its EXACT form.
- Whitepaper-truth discipline: if a paper doesn't specify a closed form, its
  dispatch is marked OPEN — never substituted with a classical/SM formula.

## What UQFF is

UQFF is a vacuum-first physics framework built on a single non-mass primitive,
`ρ_SCm = 7.09e-37 J/m³` (the SuperConductive material vacuum energy density),
and a 26-level Di-Pseudo-Monopole (DPM) structural lattice. From 9 truly-
independent primitives it derives the cosmological constant, all 7 nuclear
shell-model magic numbers exactly, the Holmlid 630 eV LENR channel exactly,
Fe-56 BE/A peak, α-particle binding, all 8 Clay Millennium Prize problems,
the complete 12-fermion Standard Model spectrum, 18+ cosmological observables,
and 5 independent LENR observation suites (Holmlid, Parkhomov, Pons-Fleischmann,
Mizuno, Rossi).

Full framework physics lives in the whitepaper corpus — the physics is the
whitepapers; the calculator computes what the whitepapers derive.

## What is currently shipped (v0.400.0)

### Wiring campaign — LIVE (see `CLAUDE.md` charter)

Sequential wiring of all 2,255 whitepapers, starting at PAPER_001.
Authorized 2026-07-28: autonomous band sessions, ship per session via
`ship.ps1`, full stop at PAPER_500 for manual review.

**Wired: 2,253 distinct dispatches (2308 DISPATCH keys incl. the 55 canonical alias numbers 2179-2233)** (one per paper, Rule B closed). **Complete-compile frontier: PAPER_001-1300** (+ b-variants) fully captured over a **1766-function primitive-sourced equation library** — every equation and section (core + Session-225 + Production Framework + Cosmogenesis Lagrangian + VDS/DVP/BSH + Kozima-LENR K.1-K.6) via _common_uqff_blocks, with paper-specific §B DVP prime ladder (gate-guarded), 40/40+ linked-paper mapping, and a campaign-aware XGEO chain.

**Derived-constants catalog (v0.344.0):** all **1,272 unique predecessor-registry derived constants** wired and callable via `uqff_derived_constants.py` — e.g. `derived_constant("alpha_inverse")` → 137.0 (PAPER_1167), `derived_constant("astro_BH_entropy_coeff")` → 0.24833 (PAPER_594). 661 numeric, routes + provenance preserved.


**Landmark-identity family (v0.347.0):** the primitive-reduction identities as callables — `mu0_vacuum_permeability()` (Maxwell EXACT), `boltzmann_k_composition()` (0.0011%), `alpha_s_kernel()`, `b_critical_schwinger()`, `bh_seed_mass_integer()`=56160, `omega_matter_exact()`=0.3, `tilt_factor_1_12()`, `kappa_derivative()`, `vacuum_coupling_kernel()`=19/160, `a5_kmex_125()`, `ftrz_so5_derivative()`, `successor_ratio_identity()`=11/10, `full_circle_degrees()`=360, `smbh_flare_frequency()`=1/1800, `frame_cadence_62()`, `planck_length_ftrz()`, `ftrz_primitive_exponent()` quintuplet, `halving_series_closure()`={2,3,5,13}, `a5_dphys_ratio()`=15, `kk_eigenvalue_spectrum()`, plus the F_TRZ power-ladder rungs (^12/^20/^27/^35/^40/^50).

**Flagship UQFF closed forms now individually callable** (v0.342.0–v0.343.0 predecessor mine): cosmological constant Λ = ρ_SCm·26!·25/12 = 5.957e-10 (Planck), proton mass 938.25 MeV and m_p/m_e = 1836 from integers, H₀ = A_5+SO_5 = 70 EXACT, Ω_Λ = 0.684, Universal Inertial Operator U_i = 2.75e-7 (Sun), Higgs vev 246 GeV, fine-structure α, electron g−2 = 0.001159652, Holmlid 630 eV / Coulomb 626 eV LENR chain, and **all 8 Clay Millennium closures** (Riemann, P≠NP, Yang-Mills=1.736, Poincaré=7/12, Navier-Stokes=0.85, Hodge=1.0, BSD, BH-info).

Registry: **6,220 rows**. Fidelity gate: **5,324 assertions**, green. *(v0.285.0/v0.321.0 burned/yanked on PyPI.)*

## Predecessor / attribution

Physics content, whitepapers, and canonical primitives originate in
[Star-Magic](https://github.com/Daniel8Murphy0007/Star-Magic).
That repository remains the canonical archive of the framework's development
history and whitepaper corpus. This repository (Star-Magic-Program) inherits
the physics and rebuilds only the code layer, correctly this time.

## Install

```
pip install star-magic-program
```

## Quick start

```python
from uqff_calculator import calc, wired_count, list_wired

print(f"Papers wired: {wired_count()}")

# Look up a specific paper (returns OPEN if not yet wired)
result = calc('PAPER_646')
print(result)

# Flagship UQFF closed forms (individually callable)
import uqff_calculator as C
print(C.cosmological_constant_26fact())   # 5.957e-10 J/m^3  (Planck Lambda)
print(C.proton_electron_ratio())          # 1836  (m_p/m_e from integers)
print(C.yang_mills_mass_gap())            # 1.736 GeV  (Millennium)

# Derived-constants catalog — 1,272 predecessor-registry constants by name
print(C.derived_constants_count())                  # 1272
print(C.derived_constant('alpha_inverse'))          # 137.0
print(C.derived_constant_record('alpha_inverse'))   # {value, formula, route, paper: PAPER_1167, ...}
print(C.list_derived_constants(sector='SI')[:5])    # filter by sector or paper
```
