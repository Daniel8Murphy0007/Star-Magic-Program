"""uqff_correlation - Part 4 of the subsurface surveying tool: WELL-TO-WELL
CORRELATION (v1.81.0), with the honest finding stated up front.

THE FINDING (2026-08-29, and re-verified on every run): with 29 globally
scattered sites, the library currently supports ZERO cross-site depth-frame
correlations - every candidate pair (CaCO3 Barbados x Walvis, thermal
conductivity Hikurangi x Prydz, friction coefficient Barbados x Costa Rica)
has overlapping depth RANGES but too few coinciding SAMPLES (max 3 common
bins against a floor of 5). The engine reports that refusal census instead
of manufacturing correlations, and the machinery stands ready for the data
that will change the answer (co-located suites, twin holes, denser columns).

WHERE THE REAL STRUCTURE LIVES - THE TIME FRAME: four sites carry archive
age models, and one (the ACEX Lomonosov Ridge age-depth model, 0-55,904 ka)
is the library's MASTER CHRONOLOGY, whose window overlaps every other
age-bearing site (Bengal 0.5-193.5 ka; EPICA 611-799 ka; Fram 12,050-17,370
ka). Time is the Earth Model's fourth axis, and this module registers it.

DISTANCE HONESTY (doctrine): a statistical correlation between sites more
than CONTINUITY_KM apart is NEVER presented as geological continuity -
the continuity_claim field says 'NONE' with the distance printed. Only
twin holes (< CONTINUITY_KM) may claim physical continuity, and none
currently qualify with shared properties.
