## 2026-07-28 — v0.1.0 SCAFFOLD (initial ship)

### Purpose

Fresh-repo systematic rebuild of the UQFF calculator, correcting the
structural failure documented in the predecessor
[Star-Magic](https://github.com/Daniel8Murphy0007/Star-Magic) repository
where the calculator layer had grown to 73,629 lines with:
- 0 imports from `uqff_registry_primitives`
- 3,352 hardcoded numeric literals framework-wide
- 20 primitives duplicated across 2-10 files each
- 1,180 whitepapers with zero calculator wiring
- 22 UQFF_LANDMARK papers with zero calculator wiring

Predecessor commit at time of split: v5.86.0 (registry sweep phase 4 complete;
73 dconsts registered, calculator gap unresolved).

### What shipped

- `uqff_registry_primitives.py` — 96 canonical constants carried verbatim from
  predecessor v5.86.0 R5 baseline. The one clean file. Gate-pinned identities:
  - 9 truly-independent primitives locked
  - 4 derivative primitives EXACT (D_BSFG, K_MEX, KAPPA, Q_PHONON, D_GW_EROSION)
  - PAPER_2131 primitive-composed particle physics identities
  - PAPER_2154 primitive-reduction landmarks (Q_phonon = 25/4, D_GW = 2/3)
  - PAPER_1573 H_0 canonical route (A_5 + SO_5 = 70 EXACT)
- `uqff_calculator.py` — scaffold skeleton with:
  - Line 1: `from uqff_registry_primitives import *` (all 96 constants)
  - Empty `DISPATCH = {}` — grown one paper at a time
  - Public interface `calc(paper_id, dataset)` returning
    `{value, formula, source, residual_pct}`
  - `_register` decorator for adding paper dispatches
  - Zero hardcoded numeric literals (gate-enforced)
- `uqff_fidelity_tests.py` — 8-block gate:
  - Block 1: locked primitive integrity
  - Block 2: derivative-primitive EXACT identities
  - Block 3: structural landmarks (halving series, VCK, tilts)
  - Block 4: Millennium prize EXACT identities
  - Block 5: H_0 canonical route
  - Block 6: PAPER_2131 primitive-composed particle physics
  - Block 7: calculator scaffold integrity
  - Block 8: banned-literal check (no registry-duplicating hardcodes)
- License: **AGPL-3.0-or-later OR LicenseRef-StarMagic-Commercial**
  (dual, matching predecessor). MIT text preserved as
  `LICENSE-MIT-INITIAL.txt` for repo-init history.
- `pyproject.toml` for PyPI publishing as `star-magic-program`.
- CI + release-to-pypi workflows.
- README, CITATION.cff, NOTICE, COMMERCIAL.md.

### What DIDN'T ship (deliberately)

- Whitepaper corpus copy — deferred to v0.2.0 (adding 2,255 files at once
  would blow first ship's diff review; better to copy in a dedicated ship).
- Any wired paper dispatches — v0.1.0 is scaffold only; wiring campaign starts
  in v0.2.0 with 46 UQFF_LANDMARK papers.
- Any surface from the predecessor's 252 `calculate_*` functions — those
  functions carried 309 hardcoded literals and grew from 7 to 252 without
  registry sync. Not being ported; will be rebuilt whitepaper-first from
  scratch.

### Discipline locked in this ship (permanent standing rules)

**Rule A — Registry is the single source of truth.**
Every canonical value flows from `uqff_registry_primitives.py`. Any hardcoded
numeric literal in `uqff_calculator.py` that duplicates a registry entry is a
gate failure.

**Rule B — One dispatch per whitepaper. No dispatch without whitepaper.**
Every entry in `DISPATCH` must cite a specific `PAPER_N` from the corpus. No
dispatches for anything the corpus doesn't derive.

**Rule C — Growth is one paper at a time.**
Every wiring ship reads one whitepaper, extracts its canonical formula, wires
one dispatch, adds one gate assertion for the paper's stated residual,
commits. No bulk wiring. No "backfill all of Bucket K in one commit."

**Rule D — OPEN over SM.**
If a whitepaper has no closed form, its dispatch returns
`{'status': 'OPEN_UQFF_DERIVATION_TARGET', ...}`. Never substitute a
classical/SM formula (predecessor Rule 4 doctrine, canonized).

**Rule E — Predecessor is read-only reference.**
No commits to `github.com/Daniel8Murphy0007/Star-Magic`. That repository is
preserved as historical archive of the framework's development.

### Predecessor delta at time of ship

| Metric | Predecessor (v5.86.0) | This repo (v0.1.0) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Total canonical-state lines | 441,167 | 1,142 |
| Redundant hardcoded literals | 3,352 | 0 |
| Files importing registry | 4 of 23 | 3 of 3 |
| Duplicate primitive definitions | 20 primitives × 2-10 files | 0 |
| Whitepapers with zero wiring | 1,180 | (deferred to v0.2.0 copy) |
| Calculator size | 73,629 lines | 79 lines |

### Next ship

**v0.2.0 — whitepaper corpus copy.** Bulk import of 2,255 whitepaper files from
predecessor into `whitepapers/` directory. Zero code changes. Establishes the
canonical corpus as read-source for the wiring campaign.

Then **v0.3.0+** — landmark wiring: PAPER_2154, PAPER_2153, PAPER_2148,
PAPER_2144, PAPER_1573, PAPER_1521, PAPER_1522, PAPER_646, PAPER_1203,
PAPER_1167 (structural spine first).
