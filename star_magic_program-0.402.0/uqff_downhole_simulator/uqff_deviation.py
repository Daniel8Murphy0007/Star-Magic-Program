"""uqff_deviation — wellbore deviation, MD vs TVD (v1.6.0 extension).

Real wells are deviated: a gauge sits at a MEASURED DEPTH (MD, distance along
the wellbore string) while the pressure and temperature it feels are set by
TRUE VERTICAL DEPTH (TVD). A vertical-well model overstates P/T at every
station of a deviated well — on a 60-degree tangent, by nearly a factor of
two in the deviated section.

`DeviationSurvey` maps MD -> TVD from survey pairs (CSV loadable) or from the
common kickoff-and-tangent well shape. Attach it to `SimulatorConfig` or
`CaseStudyConfig`: sensors stay addressed by MD (their position on the
string); the physics is evaluated at TVD.

Headless-safe: numpy only.
