"""uqff_follower — the quasi-live file-follower port (v1.10.0 extension).

Addresses the connectivity concern (Daniel, 2026-08-24) at the tier that is
buildable TODAY with zero network code and zero invented site behavior: most
historians can be configured to continuously append-export their readings to
a file. `HistorianFollower` watches that growing file, re-ingests it on each
poll, and reports how many NEW samples arrived — near-real-time monitoring
through the same read-only port machinery, feeding the same reconciler.

Design:
  * READ-ONLY, like every port. The follower never touches the source file
    beyond opening it for reading.
  * RE-INGEST, not tail-parse. Each poll re-reads the whole file through
    `read_historian_csv` and diffs by sample count. This is deliberately
    simple and robust: partial trailing lines, historian rewrites, and file
    rotation (row count DROPS -> follower resets and says so) are all handled
    by construction rather than by fragile incremental parsing. Historian
    exports at 1 reading/min are small; re-reading them is cheap.
  * NO SLEEP LOOPS inside the library. `poll()` is a single step the caller
    schedules (cron, scheduler, or the `watch()` convenience generator which
    sleeps between polls only when the caller iterates it).

Connectivity tiers after this module (the honest ladder):
  SIMULATE (v1.3.0)  -> OFFLINE-INGEST real exports (v1.8.0)
  -> FILE-FOLLOW quasi-live (THIS)  -> LIVE PROTOCOL (declared, refusing
  until site details; Modbus client pending Daniel's dependency ruling).

Headless-safe: numpy only.
